    <description>26/10/2016 - Garth James (Salesforce) - Created. 
This field stores the Username for the account owner for newly created accounts during JIT provisioning for suppliers. Said another way, when the SupplierJITProvisioner class runs to create a new account, it will use this value to find the account owner. 

To be clear: this is meant to be that user&apos;s NICKNAME (as opposed to Username or Email address). This is because the Nickname is unique.</description>
